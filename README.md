# React.js_Rocket_Ignite_Challenge-01_ToDoList
A To-Do list application with ReactJS


It is a simple To-Do List application, beginner level. But that already allows me to put into practice some important concepts.

# The concepts
- Create a React js project from scratch based on a Figma design.
- Componentization
- States
- State immutability
- Lists and Keys in ReactJS
- Properties

# The requirements for this challenge:
- Add a new task
- Mark and unmark a task as complete
- Remove a task from the list
- Show task completion progress
